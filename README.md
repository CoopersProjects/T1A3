## R6:
List of features in my application:
- Ability to add new animals
--> This will use variables as "name", "age", "species", "zone" and "date_rescued".
--> I will be able to add new animals and information about the animals into the registery.

- Ability to delete entries once released
--> Once the conservation is no longer required, you will be able to delete the entry as it is no longer required.

- Ability to display a complete list of entries
--> This requires a loop to check over the list of entries.
--> This allows the user to see all existing entries in a list.

- Ability to search for individual zones (e.g. "Zone 2").
--> This also requires a loop to check the information and return.
--> Allows user to search for key zone to see what animals occupy a zone.

- Ability to edit existing information
--> Allows user to edit information if required, e.g. age increase.

Error handling will also be covered by making sure that appropriate messages or information is displayed when an "unexpected entry" is provided.
