# T1A3 - Cooper Scott
My application is a wildlife conservation "entries" system that keeps track of what animals are inside the facility and information about them.

## R1-R3 (Don't require individual answers)

## R4: 
My GitHub Repo is: https://github.com/CoopersProjects/T1A3

## R5: 
I will be using the PEP-8 style guide to maintain consistency throughout my project.

## R6:
List of features in my application:
- Ability to add new animals
--> This will use variables as "name", "age", "species", "zone" and "date_rescued".
--> I will be able to add new animals and information about the animals into the registery.

- Ability to delete entries once released
--> Once the conservation is no longer required, you will be able to delete the entry as it is no longer required.

- Ability to display a complete list of entries
--> This requires a loop to check over the list of entries.
--> This allows the user to see all existing entries in a list.

- Ability to search for individual zones (e.g. "Zone 2").
--> This also requires a loop to check the information and return.
--> Allows user to search for key zone to see what animals occupy a zone.

- Ability to edit existing information
--> Allows user to edit information if required, e.g. age increase.

Error handling will also be covered by making sure that appropriate messages or information is displayed when an "unexpected entry" is provided.

## R7: 
For R7 I will link my monday.com project management photos. Here I used a checklist to tick off required parts of my features.

My plan was to complete the major coding requirements by the 21st of December so that I could focus on compiling everything I need together and making sure I am happy with my work and have it organised. In order for that to happen, I created the project management page on monday.com and used it to tick off general goals that I wanted to have completed. I generally started each feature of my project with the goal of completing the method before moving on to using the method to write the code I wanted to run. Once that was complete, I tested that it worked which took a long time, especially with features such as the editing feature as I was having a recurring problem that I will mention in the slide-deck and video. I prioritised getting the features complete so that way I can move onto the other aspects of the work closer to the deadline. Below I have attached some photos of my management photos over time, however they are quite generalised as I was figuring out what I needed to do as I went along and then after learning what to do it was a lot of "rinse and repeating".
